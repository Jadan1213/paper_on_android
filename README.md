# Paper server on Android device!

This guide will show you how you can run a Minecraft Paper server on and Android device.

DISCLAIMER: You really shouldn't do this. It's not going to run as well as a real machine with more powerful hardware. You do you though. I did it for the fun of it. You don't want to do this. Just don't. Seriously, why am I even writing this? This is crazy!
